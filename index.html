          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Shrunked is an extension that resizes your photos before you upload them to a website or email them. It greatly reduces the time spent waiting for photos to upload.</p>
          <p>You can get Shrunked from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/shrunked-image-resizer?src=external-github">addons.mozilla.org</a>. If you got it from somewhere else, it's not genuine. Visit a.m.o. and get a fresh copy.</p>
          <p style="text-align: center"><img src="3.2-options.png" width="485" height="405" alt="Shrunked Image Resizer dialog in version 3.2" /></p>
        </section><section id="main_right">

          <p>Add-ons are available for free, but developing and supporting them does take a considerable amount of time. Please consider making a donation to help me pay my bills.
